# Caesar Cipher Text Encryption/Decryption Application

The Caesar Cipher Text Encryption/Decryption Application allows users to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext using a given key and decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext with the correct key. This simple web application demonstrates the Caesar Cipher technique, a basic encryption method.

## Usage

### Step 1: Open the Application
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Step 2: Enter Plaintext
In the "Plaintext" field, enter the text you want to encrypt.
### Step 3: Enter Key
In the "Key" field, enter a number between 0 and 25. This key will be used for both encryption and decryption.
### Step 4: Encrypt Plaintext
Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the ciphertext. The encrypted text will appear in the "Ciphertext" field.
### Step 5: Decrypt Ciphertext
To decrypt, enter the ciphertext in the "Ciphertext" field and the same key in the "Key" field.
Click the "Decrypt" button to revert the ciphertext to the original plaintext. The decrypted text will appear in the "Plaintext" field.

## How to Run

1. System Requirements - must be Linux/Mac/Windows

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
